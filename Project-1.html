        I worked on the mobile application as one of their first designers, enhancing their brand identity and redesigning their mobile prototype to provide users with the experience of their everyday social media platform but in augmented reality. 
        Throughout my 5 months at SuperWorld, I was able collaborate with innovative team members and product managers to grow from being a UI designer to a product thinker whose designs help solve business goals.

                It was also my first time operating within a massive ecosystem like Amazon. 
                I learned a lot about collaborating across different time zones, operating within a sprawling design network, and committing to my decisions. 
                My project helped push me into becoming a better, more confident designer.

                My primary internship project was to create new credit factor pages in the mobile experience, combining the existing dashboard of the MyLendingTree web app. 
                The feature is designed to aid transparent financial projections, detailing the impact of credit factors on credit scores.
